- 👋 Hi, I’m @TianaLC
- 👀 I’m interested in User Experience and Graphic Design
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UX Design and I'm currently confused on how to use GitHub. I see projects I would like to contribute to but am unsure of what steps I need to take to start designing for them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on UX Projects, I'm looking to get experience on real projects.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
